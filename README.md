# Pi in the Sky

## Planning

### Goal

The goal of this project is in the name. We want to get our Raspberry Pi in the air. We can get it there in any fashion we want but it has to specifically do a couple things: Collect acceleration during its flight, and know when its at the top of its flight. Besides that though, it's completely open-ended, and we can take this in any direction we want. We are hoping we can make something pretty coool.

### Resources and Constraints

We have the entire sigma lab at our disposal on this one. While we will likely need to use a variety of different things, it's important that we don't simply waste materials as a lot of the stuff in here is pretty expensive. We want to make this as efficient as possible. The other big constraint is time. Although it seems like we have a lot of time, it's going to fly by, and if we aren't careful, we won't get much accomplished.

#### Materials

* Proper plastic bottles
* Polyurethane based adhesive
* Sand paper
* Knife
* Carbon Fiber or Fiber Glass
* Plastic gloves
* Some type of resin
* Tommy timer
* Parachute
* 8mm Plywood
* Assortment of pipe parts
* Spray paint (optional)
* Hose
* Air pump (of some sort)

### Brainstorming

* Rocket :kissing:
* Hang Glider :smirk:
* Kite :confused:
* Cannon :angry:
* Bird :neutral_face:

### Solution

We decided to go with the rocket. After much debate and research, we came to the conclusion that the rocket project would provide just the right amount of ambition and doability. We had a little hesitancy simply because it was a popular choice among the other groups, but we are going to strive to make the best possible rocket while also being able to record accurate results.

### Initial Design

### Milestone Schedule

* 3/8/19: By the end of our first week, we will have made a decision on what we're going to do. We need to weigh a lot of options and pick something that is both ambitious and realistic.
* 3/15/19: We will have finished our initial planning, and we will have a solid design of what we want our product to look like. 
* 3/22/19: We will have carefully selected the appropriate material that we want our rocket to be made out of, and we will have some progress going with the actual design of the thing.
* 3/29/19: This week will be spent continung our design in Solidworks, and we should also have some progress on the Pi coding part.
* 4/12/19: Now that we have adjusted our ideas a bit, we will need some more time. At this point, we should putting together a prototype.
* 4/19/19: We may have to go out and buy some bottles to make the prototype.
* 4/26/19: We should be designing some new and refined parts in Solidworks and maybe getting a print or two in.
* 5/3/19: Time to start putting together the prototype. As of now we are not sure we will include the parachute or not.
* 5/10/19: Testing week for the prototype. Once this is done we can start on the real thing.
* 5/20/19 :laughing:

### Revised Solution

So we're gonna really amp it up. We figured that because this will be our last project at CHS, we want to make it special. We decided to turn this into a water rocket capable of flying pretty darn high. It's gonna take a lot of work and a ton of precision but we want to be ambitious and go for it.


## Mark I

 So, our first prototype was given the name Mark I, inspired by the GOAT Tony Stark. First, we did lots of research regarding local bottles to use. We ended up settling for a sparkling water at a local Walmart, which happened to also taste very good. Once we got the bottles in the lab, we got started on working. We cut the bottles according to our plan. One was cut on both sides, while the other to still had the bottle cap attached. We then used a bowl to hold water whiched we microwaved to a temperature that was hot enough to shrink the plastic. The idea was to shrink one side of the plastic to slot it into the other bottle, and then glue the joints together, and then tape. We executed this almost perfectly, except for one end of the bottle which we shrunk a bit too much so it had some irregularities. INSERT PICTURE WHICH IDK HOW TO DO! The adhesive we used to glue the joints together was a Gorilla Glue Epoxy. After applying it to our rocket, not without getting it stuck on ourselves, we let it dry for 24 hours. Then the two of us went our separate ways on Solidworks: Joe worked on a cap for the rocket, while I designed the fins.
 
 The idea for the cap was that a pole would be attached to the cap that would fit snugly through the bottle neck. We got the snug fit right on the first try, however this cap would become our downfall eventually. For the fins, I looks at different fin designs. I noticed that for larger rockets, longer, shorter fins worked better, and for smaller rockets, smaller fins that extruded more from the rocket worked best. So, since ours is on the relatively smaller side, we decided to go with the smaller fins that extruded more from the bottle. It was at this point in the process that we made our first real mistake, gluing the fins on before you are finished with everything else. When your fins are made of balsa wood, they become very easy to break. And so break they did. We even broke one of the fins in two different places.
 
 One day, while we were strolling around with our rocket, Mr. H walked up to us asking about the rocket. He pointed our one glaring proble  with the rocket, with all of that air pressure built up, the cap of our rocket would just pop off like some sort of cannon. Because of this, we decided it would be best to break out the epoxy again, this time for the cap. We lathered the rod and the inside of the bottle opening with epoxy and then squeezed them together.
 
 Now it was time for the tape job. We wrapped a couple layers of duct tape around the joints where we had already used epoxy. Then, for extra security, and looks, we wrapped the nose, or cap, of our rocket with electrical tape. Once finished with the important tape job, we branded the side of it with its name: Mark I.
