# Pi in the Sky

## Planning

### Goal

The goal of this project is in the name. We want to get our Raspberry Pi in the air. We can get it there in any fashion we want but it has to specifically do a couple things: Collect acceleration during its flight, and know when its at the top of its flight. Besides that though, it's completely open-ended, and we can take this in any direction we want. We are hoping we can make something pretty coool.

### Resources and Constraints

We have the entire sigma lab at our disposal on this one. While we will likely need to use a variety of different things, it's important that we don't simply waste materials as a lot of the stuff in here is pretty expensive. We want to make this as efficient as possible. The other big constraint is time. Although it seems like we have a lot of time, it's going to fly by, and if we aren't careful, we won't get much accomplished.
