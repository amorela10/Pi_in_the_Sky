# Pi in the Sky

## Planning

### Goal

The goal of this project is in the name. We want to get our Raspberry Pi in the air. We can get it there in any fashion we want but it has to specifically do a couple things: Collect acceleration during its flight, and know when its at the top of its flight. Besides that though, it's completely open-ended, and we can take this in any direction we want. We are hoping we can make something pretty coool.

### Resources and Constraints

We have the entire sigma lab at our disposal on this one. While we will likely need to use a variety of different things, it's important that we don't simply waste materials as a lot of the stuff in here is pretty expensive. We want to make this as efficient as possible. The other big constraint is time. Although it seems like we have a lot of time, it's going to fly by, and if we aren't careful, we won't get much accomplished.

#### Materials

* Proper plastic bottles
* Polyurethane based adhesive
* Sand paper
* Knife
* Carbon Fiber or Fiber Glass
* Plastic gloves
* Some type of resin
* Tommy timer
* Parachute
* 8mm Plywood
* Assortment of pipe parts
* Spray paint (optional)
* Hose
* Air pump (of some sort)

### Brainstorming

* Rocket :kissing:
* Hang Glider :smirk:
* Kite :confused:
* Cannon :angry:
* Bird :neutral_face:

### Solution

We decided to go with the rocket. After much debate and research, we came to the conclusion that the rocket project would provide just the right amount of ambition and doability. We had a little hesitancy simply because it was a popular choice among the other groups, but we are going to strive to make the best possible rocket while also being able to record accurate results.

### Initial Design

### Milestone Schedule

* 3/8/19: By the end of our first week, we will have made a decision on what we're going to do. We need to weigh a lot of options and pick something that is both ambitious and realistic.
* 3/15/19: We will have finished our initial planning, and we will have a solid design of what we want our product to look like. 
* 3/22/19: We will have carefully selected the appropriate material that we want our rocket to be made out of, and we will have some progress going with the actual design of the thing.
* 3/29/19: This week will be spent continung our design in Solidworks, and we should also have some progress on the Pi coding part.
* 4/12/19: Now that we have adjusted our ideas a bit, we will need some more time. At this point, we should putting together a prototype.
* 4/19/19: We may have to go out and buy some bottles to make the prototype.
* 4/26/19: We should be designing some new and refined parts in Solidworks and maybe getting a print or two in.
* 5/3/19: Time to start putting together the prototype. As of now we are not sure we will include the parachute or not.
* 5/10/19: Testing week for the prototype. Once this is done we can start on the real thing.
* 5/20/19 :laughing:

### Revised Solution

So we're gonna really amp it up. We figured that because this will be our last project at CHS, we want to make it special. We decided to turn this into a water rocket capable of flying pretty darn high. It's gonna take a lot of work and a ton of precision but we want to be ambitious and go for it.
